#For this project, I used SQL to query this Spotify database to answer a few questions I came up with based on artist, where they rank, as well as miscellaneous comparisons through potential relativity.

#What is the most popular song, and who performs it; assuming that 100 is equal to #1?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 1;

#What is the least danceable song and where does it rank?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, MIN(danceability) AS danceable, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY danceability
ORDER BY danceable asc
LIMIT 1;

#Which artist released the most songs in this database?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) AS songs_released
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING songs_released > 2
ORDER BY songs_released desc;

#Who is the lowest ranked artist on the list and what factors could potentially be the reason why?
SELECT *
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE loudness
AND popularity < 70
ORDER BY popularity desc;
